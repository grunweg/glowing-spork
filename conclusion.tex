\section*{Summary}
% To conclude: we have seen what symplectic manifolds are; describing the evolution of a mechanical system naturally leads to a symplectic manifolds.
% Symplectic geometry can answer questions about periodic orbits of these mechanical system: by defining invariants based on counting pseudo-holomorphic curves.
% Defining and understanding them requires understanding moduli spaces of holomorphic curves, with significant technical machinery.

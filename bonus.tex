% What's a very basic question you could ask? (Pause)
% Right, you may wonder: does a given smooth manifold admit a symplectic structure?
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Which manifolds are symplectic?}
  \begin{itemize}
    % the big surprise is: we don't fully know! we don't have a general equivalent criterion
    % I've told you three equivalent definitions by now, but their equivalence is "shallow". Does not help for determining.
    \item no full answer known! % for open manifolds, there is an h-principle: TODO LOOK UP! a non-degenerate 2-form suffices, is homotopic to a closed one
    \item necessary conditions
    \begin{itemize}
      \item even dimension, orientable % symplectic form induces a volume form
      \item $\exists$ (compatible) almost complex structure
      % will talk about this later; in fact implies the previous bullet
      \item if compact: $H^{2i}(M)\neq 0$ for $0 < 2i < \dim(M)$
      \item additional conditions on dimension 4 % (coming from Seiberg-Witten theory)
      % bonus: look up details and insert here; perhaps a space prob. w/o acs
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{block}{Example}
    Sphere $\sphere{n}$ is \highlight{not} symplectic for $n>2$. % (by de Rham cohomology).
    % Atiyah tried to show \not\exists complex structure on S‚Å∂; almost complex one is clear.
    % TODO add!... does not admit a complex structure

  \frametitle{Proof sketch of Arnold conjecture}
  given $(M,\omega)$ closed*; $H\colon \sphere{1}\times M\to \R$ smooth non-degenerate
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $CF_k(M)$ is generated by $1$-periodic orbits with index $k$
    \item in particular: $\# 1\text{-periodic orbits} \geq \sum_k \rk HF_k(M)$
    \item Morse theory: $\sum_k \rk H_k(M)\geq \sum_{i=0}^{2n} \rk H_k(M)$
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{theorem}
    For each $k$, there is an isomorphism $HF_k(M)\cong H_{2n-k}(M)$.
